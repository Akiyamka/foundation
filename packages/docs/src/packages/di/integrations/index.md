# Integrations

`@wroud/di` is a flexible dependency injection (DI) system designed to be compatible with a variety of JavaScript environments. Currently, the following integration is available:

## React Integration ([`@wroud/di-react`](./react/overview.md))

The `@wroud/di-react` package integrates the `@wroud/di` library with React, allowing developers to inject services directly into React components. It offers hooks such as `useService` for easy service resolution and supports advanced features like lazy loading through React Suspense.

This integration simplifies managing dependencies in React applications while maintaining a small bundle size and high performance.
